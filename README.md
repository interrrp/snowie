# Overview

Snowie is a Christmas-themed Discord bot. That is, most of its commands are
related to the holiday, and therefore is a fun bot to have in your server!

# Features

- A lot of fun commands
- Good-looking website made with [Next.js](https://next.js.org) and
  [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)

# Commands

You may find a full list of commands on the
[website](https://snowie-six.vercel.app/commands).

# Self-hosting

Snowie is a _different_ kind of Discord bot. That is, it doesn't use any of the
"traditional" bot frameworks, such as [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) or
[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable). Instead, it uses
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a [React](https://react.dev) framework, to power
its commands. This means that you can self-host Snowie on Vercel, or any other
hosting platform that supports Next.js.
